Welcome to Solidity Nirvana, the ultimate guide to Solidity.

There are five levels of difficulty one must progress through to attain full enlightment.
- Easy
- Medium
- Hard
- Complex
- Master

Each difficult has its own repository, each with an `episodes` folder that contains:
- A file called `_Notes.txt` which outlines the agenda for the episode and has reference links
- A few Solidity contracts, used to teach and demonstrate new concepts
- A folder named `scenarios`, which utilizes base-level contracts to showcase functionality
- A folder named `puzzles`, which contains puzzles you must solve to progress and reinforce your knowledge
