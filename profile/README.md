Welcome to Solidity Nirvana, the ultimate guide to Solidity.

There are five levels of difficulty one must progress through to attain full enlightment.
- [Easy](https://github.com/Solidity-Nirvana/Easy)
- Medium
- Hard
- Complex
- Master

Each difficult has its own repository, each with an `episodes` folder that contains:
- A file called `_Agenda.txt` which outlines the agenda for the episode and has reference links
- A folder named `scenarios`, which contains a series of contracts to showcase examples and demonstrate ideas
- A folder named `puzzles`,   which contains a series of puzzles you must solve to progress and reinforce your knowledge
